# TempHumi
CleanBits is going to place the product that consists of temperature and humidity sensors in every class in universities and high schools to measure the temperature and humidity values of each class. These values are going to be used to find the most suitable values for student success. To correlate these values with student success, CleanBits is going to analyze the attendance rate and quiz scores that students are going to attend at the end of lessons. By analyzing these temperature and humidity values, and student scores (attendance rate and quiz scores), the most suitable class environment can be found. Since every province has different weather conditions, the most suitable temperature and humidity values for the classes will vary from city to city, even from season to season. With the help of this variation factor, the product and system are going to be used continuously, not once. “Monthly membership” method will be offered to high schools and universities that want to use the TempHumi system to increase the success rate of their students.
